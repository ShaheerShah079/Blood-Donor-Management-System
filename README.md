I developed the above mentioned system using basic knowledge of C such as arrays, loops , structures and functions.Employed three main structures: Donor, Acceptor, and Staff, to efficiently manage the system's data.

Implemented various functions to perform multiple queries and tasks within the system. These functions included:
Listing all donors
Searching donors by name/age
Sorting donors by name/age
Determining the number of male and female donors
Calculating total blood donated to acceptors
Calculating total staff salary
Providing staff information based on ID
Checking donor availability
Searching donors by blood group or city e.t.c
